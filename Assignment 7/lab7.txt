1. git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils
2. git log > git-log.txt
3. git tag > git-tags.txt
4. First, to find the commit entitled “maint: quote 'like this' or "like 
this", not `like this'”, I opened git-log.txt 
I then proceeded to execute the command:
C-s to search for the quote. Correspondingly, the commit is:
62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
In order to create the patch, I executed the following command:

git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5. I then checked out version 3.0 of diffutils from my repository:
git checkout v3.0

6. I then proceeded to apply my patch:
patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

Below are the problems that occured:

7. I then proceeded to execute the command git status:

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

8. I learned the emacs functions specified on the project specs.

9. First I went into the following files with emacs: 
src/diff.h
doc/diagmeet.note
ms/config.bat
ms/config.site
NEWS
po/en.po
README
TODO
src/system.h
tests/help-version

and executed the emacs command 
C-x v u. I entered yes when prompted with the yes or no question

I then used the following c files and went into them using emacs:
src/analyze.c
src/cmp.c
src/context.c
src/diff.c
src/diff3.c
src/dir.c
src/ifdef.c
src/io.c
src/sdiff.c
src/side.c
src/util.c

I then proceeded to execte the commands C-x v = command in all of my c files.
I noticed that the chaneges corresponded to lines. Thus, I went to the 
corresponding lines to implement the changes necessitated utilizing M-gg, 
undoing all changes other than character string constants. The following
are the lines that I modified. Note that the lines correspond to the lines
in the diff file, and that the lines actually changed in the c files
is the number denoted plus three.

analyze.c: 38, 251, 595
cmp.c: 36, 364,365, 377
context.c: 159, 289, 393, 431, 459
diff.c: 40, 57, 58, 59, 92, 98
diff3.c: 35, 159, 1475
dir.c: 84, 125, 234
ifdef.c: 132
io.c: 57, 60
sdiff.c: 35, 92, 747
side.c: 292, 302, 310
util.c: 27, 121, 146, 149, 190, 241, 270, 650

10. I then proceeded to go into my rej files, which were diff.c.rej and
diff3.c.rej. 

I then mannually updated the changes in my c files accordingly, utilizing 
M-gg to go to the specified lines and make changes. It is important to note
that the lines do not necessarily match up, which is probably why the patch
did not make the changes we wanted. We fix this issue by manually making the
changes ourselves. The lines that we utilize M-gg for are not totally accurate,
but give a rough idea of where the change we need to make likely is. I utilized
C-s as well to find the correct lines if the lines from the diff file did not
give me a good idea

diff3.c: 433
diff.c: 876, 906, 911, 921 (using C-s), 923 (using C-s)

11. I then proceeded to execute:
git clean -f 
to remove all untracked files

12. I then proceeded to run git status to see the number of modifed files:
git status
# HEAD detached at v3.0
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   src/cmp.c
#       modified:   src/diff.c
#       modified:   src/diff3.c
#       modified:   src/dir.c
#       modified:   src/sdiff.c
#       modified:   src/util.c
#

Evidently, there were six modified files.

I then ran:
git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt 
to generate my diff file, which was 327 lines

13.
To build the resulting modified version of diffutils, I did the following 
commands:
./bootstrap
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter20/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
patch -p0  < diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check

Upon running make check, I got the following errors:
/bin/sh: /bin/sh: cannot execute binary file
make[3]: *** [basic.log] Error 126
make[3]: Leaving directory `/w/home.25/cs/ugrad/minh/CS35L/Assignment7/thirdDir/diffutils1/tests'
make[2]: *** [check-TESTS] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/w/home.25/cs/ugrad/minh/CS35L/Assignment7/thirdDir/diffutils1/tests'
make[1]: *** [check-am] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/w/home.25/cs/ugrad/minh/CS35L/Assignment7/thirdDir/diffutils1/tests'
make: *** [check-recursive] Error 1

I then executed the commands:
./src/diff . - and
./src/diff --help

Evaluating the output of these commands, I saw that the ` were replaced with ',
verifying the validity of my changes.

14.First, I copied the original sorce code into a directory diffutils-3.0
and the latter source code into a directory called diffutils-3.0-patch:

I first created my two directories
mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch
mkdir diffutils-3.0

I then cloned the diffutils directory and put it in the directory diffutilsTemp
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutilsTemp

I then changed into my diffutilsTemp and checkedout the v3.0 branch
cd diffUtilsTemp
git checkout v3.0

I then proceeded to copy the source code into the diffutils-3.0 file we
created:
cp ./src/*.c /u/cs/ugrad/minh/CS35L/Assignment7/thirdDir/diffutils-3.0

I then went into my patched version, which is in the directory diffutils
cd diffutils
cp ./src/*.c /u/cs/ugrad/minh/CS35L/Assignment7/thirdDir/diffutils-3.0-patch

I then preformed the following command
./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch/ >
quote-3.0-test.txt

as specified by the project specs

15. 
I then utilized the command:
diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
While there were many differenes between the two files, it is clear that the
changes are trivial, because they mostly coincide with differences in paths
and trivial changes in quotation marks.
