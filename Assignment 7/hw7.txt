2. Note that my diffutils is in the directory thirdDir, which is in
the directory diffutils1. This is because I ran into an error previously where
I ran out of space in my terminal, and restarted the process of making changes
to diffutils.
 
cd thirdDir
cd diffutils1

I then proceeded to checkout version3.0 of diffutils into a new branch named
quote
git checkout -b quote v3.0

3. I then installed changes into my new branch by running the following patch
command:
patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

5. I proceeded to emacs into all 6 of the .c files that were modified in git
status, enterting the command 
C-x 4 a
to create changelogs for the following 6 files:
cmp.c
diff.c
diff3.c
dir.c
sdiff.c
util.c

6. I then committed my changes by executing the following command:
git commit -aF ChangeLog

The -a flag stages all our files, while the -F command takes the commit
message from the given file.

7. As indicated by the specs, I utiized the command git format-patch
to generate a file formatted-patch.txt:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8.
I first made a directory called HomeworkQ8Verify
mkdir HomeworkQ8Verify
cd HomeworkQ8Verify
I then cloned a new repository from the website
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils 


cd diffutils
I then checked out a branch called patchery
git checkout -b patchery v3.0

I then went into my diffutils1 and moved my formatted-patch.txt file to my new
directory with my fresh version of diffutils

cd ..
cd diffutils1
mv formatted-patch.txt /u/cs/ugrad/minh/CS35L/Assignment7/thirdDir/HomeworkQ8Verify/diffutils

I then applied the patch in my diffutils that was in HomeworkQ8Verify, 
as specified by the directions in the specifications:
git am formatted-patch.txt

I then ran the commands to build the resulting modified version of diffutils:
./bootstrap
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter20/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
patch -p0  < diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check

I then proceeded to test the functionality of the commands by changing
directory into src:

cd src

I then ran the first command:
./src/diff . -

which outputted:
./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

I then ran the second command:
./src/diff --help

which outputted the correct functionality in which ` were replaced with '.

9.
I then ran the command:
make distdir
to verify that the ChangeLog entry worked

I inspected the ChangeLog by executing the command:
emacs diffutils*/ChangeLog,
in which I saw that my ChangeLog was sucessfully updated with the 6 comments
I had previously made.

10.
As indicated by my TA in lecture, I proceeded to change directories into
~eggert/src/gnu/ by executing the command:

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/

I then changed direcotry into emacs-CS-35L:

cd emacs-CS-35

I then got an error when running gitk:
Application initialization failed: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
Error in startup script: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
    while executing
"load /usr/lib64/tk8.5/../libtk8.5.so Tk"
    ("package ifneeded Tk 8.5.13" script)
    invoked from within
"package require Tk"
    (file "/usr/local/cs/bin/gitk" line 10)

I then proceeded to download Xmimg, as specified by piazza when individuals
ran into a similar error, and ran the same commands previously

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/
cd emacs-CS-35L
gitk

I then found the newest commit no more recent than January 25th to be a commit
made by Trevor Murphy <trevor.m.murphy@gmail.com> which was made on 
2015-01-25 23:56:37 and was 
lisp/gnus/nnimap.el Allow using the Google X-GM-LABELS, if present


The description of the changes Trevor made is in the leftmost top window,
the author is in the middle upmost window, and the timestamp of the update
is in the rightmost upper window. 

Furthermore, the window below the top windows has a scrollview. On the top of
the scrollview window, there exists an  overall summary of the status of the
commit of the user (including the author, committer, parent, child, branches, 
follows, and precedes). Below that in the scrollbar window, the window 
showcases the differences that the user made, in the format of diff file 
syntax.  Lastly, the window to the right of this scrollbar window 
is labelled Comments, which showcases our changeLogs and all the files
that were updated.
