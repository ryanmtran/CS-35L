First, I utilized the cd command to enter the directory specified by the
project specs:
cd  ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L

1. To find the disk space required to represent the working files in this
directory, I found the size of the entire repo minus the size of the .git
directory, as this defines the working files in our repository.

First I utilized du -h on the current directory I'm on
du -h
which yielded 509M
The -h command was necessary so that the size would be printed in human 
readable language.

I then proceeded to change directories into .git, and executed the du -h
command again
cd .git
du -h
which yielded 350M
Consequently, we see that the resulting size of the working files is
159M.

The size of the Git repository is 350M. 

The file that takes up the most space is pack, which has the filepath
./.git/objects/pack. The packfile is the largest becaue it contains all
the objects that have been removed from the filesystem. Clearly, this would
consume an immense amount of memory, as the packfile is retaining a system
that allows an individual to access deleted information, which would be
immensely large for grand-scale long-lasting projects

2. First to find the number of remote branches, I did:
git branch -r | wc
I found that there were 177 lines, so there were 177 remote branches

To find the number of local branches, I found the number of branches in 
my repository, I did
git branch -a | wc to find the number of local branches and remote branches,
and I simply found the difference between the total number of lines from the 
-a command with the answer I got previously

git branch -a | wc
Which yielded 353 lines. The difference I got was 176, so there are 176 local
branches.

3. To find the number of remote repositories, I utilized the command:
git remote show
which displayed the output
origin

Evidently, we see that there is only one repository remote to this one.
Utilizing the -v flag for verbose, we are able to find where the origin 
repository is
git remote -v:

origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (fetch)
origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (push)

4.
I utilized the command git for-each-ref, to iterate over all the refs,
utilizing the flags sort wnr count to display 10 of the files in 10 of
the branches in sorted order of commit date, most recent first. For sort,
equating the flag to the - sorts the information with most recent first and
specifying comitterdate afterwards makes the program know we are doing this
by the date that it was comitted. Equating --count with 10 prints out the
first 10 outputs, and setting the pattern to comitterdate showcases the 
matches that relate
git for-each-ref --sort='-*committerdate' --count=10

5. In order to find the number of commits in our master branch, I utilized
the command git rev-list, in conjunction with the flag count, which prints
out the number of commits that resulted from the output of this command.
git rev-list --count master

Correspondingly, the output was
139583

6. First, to find the number of commits that are in any branch, I utilized 
git rev-list with the --all flag, which pretends as if all the refs along
with HEAD are listed on the command line as <commit>
git rev-list --all --coiunt

[minh@lnxsrv06 /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L]$ git rev-list --all --count
143910

I then computed the ratio of the previously computed value, 139583 divided
by 143910

The percentage was 96.99 percent.

7. I utilized the command git shortlog to summarize the git log output.
Correspondingly, I utilized the flags -s to showcase a summary --since to
show commits starting from 2013, and -n to sort by number of commits per author
instead of alphabetically. I then piped this into head -10 to only show
the first 10 lines.

git shortlog -n -s --since="2013-01-01" | head -10:

  3691  Eli Zaretskii
  3644  Glenn Morris
  3604  Paul Eggert
  1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
  1784  Stefan Monnier
  1571  Michael Albinus
   619  Dmitry Gutov
   576  Noam Postavsky
   471  Alan Mackenzie
   469  Juri Linkov

8. I proceed to connect xming with my terminal. I then utilized gitk with the
following commits to expore the relationshop between the commits
	4ea37c2b8b0c5a68fde59770c3536195e0972217

	98ac36efe4ce4bd3a0bca76fc73ce6c7abaa4371


I saw that:
4ea37... was the parent of 977c...
4ea37... was the parent of 625c...
5490... was the grand grand parent of 4ea...
0c06... was the grand parent of 5490...

At this point, I saw that to identify if a commit was a merge commit it will
have the format:
     merge from...

Going through the rest of the commits, I saw that the merge commits were:
      0c06b93c1e467debd401eb0b3be4652fde14fa95
      abcb2e62dae6aa26308f7ac9efc89247f89cbe65
